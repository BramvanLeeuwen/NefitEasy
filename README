Bosch Control (Nefit Easy and likely Worcester Wave, Junkers Control)
=====================================================================
This is the c code to connect to a touchscreen thermostat from Bosch
with wifi access (rebranded depending on supplier it seems, see title,
tested with a Nefit Easy). The thermostat connects to a Bosch server by
xmpp, see https://xmpp.org. Clients like smartphones etc, can connect to the
same server and can request the server to forward HTTP request / commands
to the thermostat on their behalf.

This code does the same, but as a command line binary, only fetching
values at the moment.

Building
--------
The build depends on
  - json-c
  - openssl
  - libstrophe (http://strophe.im/libstrophe/)

The first two are available from the package manager at least on Ubuntu
(the *-dev packages need to be installed). The last one is on github,
https://github.com/strophe/libstrophe.

The nefit-easy.pro can be opened by qtcreator (not that qt is used, but it
is a nice IDE available on linux). After selecting a target the following
environmental variables must be added to project -> run -> run enviroment ->
details -> Batch Edito

NEFIT_SERIAL_NUMBER=123456789
NEFIT_ACCESS_KEY=abcdefhijklmnopq
NEFIT_PASSWORD=wachtw

(they are printing on the front of the manual, the password might be written
on it as well). After this pressing debug should give json output in the
Application Output Window.


To build from a command line use:

qmake ./nefit-easy.pro
make

export above mentioned variables and start the application (./netfit-easy).

Supported platforms
